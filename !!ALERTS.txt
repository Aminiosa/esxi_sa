Community Supported VIBs are not supported and do not have a digital signature. To
protect the security and integrity of your ESXi hosts do not allow unsigned
(CommunitySupported) VIBs to be installed on your hosts.
Recommendations:
Foreach ($VMHost in Get-VMHost ) {
$ESXCli = Get-EsxCli -VMHost $VMHost
$ESXCli.software.acceptance.Set("PartnerSupported")
}
